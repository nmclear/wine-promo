export const description = `We are blessed to have found a home in the Central Lake community, and are proud to make it the smallest town in Michigan to have its own distillery (sorry Three Oaks)! Even when we were new to town we were treated like family, and we are thrilled to be contributing to all the great things happening here. Support for our local communities is woven into our purpose, and we are excited to be a part of all the new initiatives and activities taking place around our Central Lake home.`;
export const descriptionMore = `Expanding our presence into the Traverse City community was an obvious next step for us, and we are excited to be part of this vibrant and energetic neighborhood of makers. Our TC Outpost offers fabulous craft and classic cocktails, but we're far more than just a lounge. Visit our maker space to learn about the distilling process, buy a bottle to take home, sign up for a class or book your next event here for a uniquely interactive experience. This location is an extension of our Torch Lake production campusâ€”come see how!`;
