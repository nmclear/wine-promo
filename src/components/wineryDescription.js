So, true to his Italian heritage, he planted exotic varieties like Nebbiolo, Sangiovese and others. Combined with a little creative grape growing and a lot of attention, today his dream has become a reality. Along with classic area grapes like Cabernet Franc and Merlot, Mari Vineyards produces a wide variety of red wines unlike anything else produced in Michigan.`
